lambda, proc, block,Proc.new::

 1. in ruby blocks are not objects
 2. we can convert blocks into callable objects by using procs and lambdas
 3. procks,lambdas and blocks are called as clousers
 4. clousers::  are objects which are having access to local variables in which they have called.
    ex:: if they have called in method they can be access the local variables in the corresponding method

LAMBDA::
ex::
 lamda without aruments:

    @lamda_sample = lambda{puts "sample lambda";puts "another statement"}
    @lamda_sample.call

 lamda with arguments::
    @lamda_sample = lambda{|i| puts i*100}
      @lamda_sample.call(10)
    @lamda_sample = lambda{|i,j| puts i*j}
      @lamda_sample.call(10,20)


2. in ruby 1.8.x lambda== proc(spell it like lower case proc) and in ruby 1.9.x Proc.new == proc
3. lambda will have a method like behaviour i.e if you pass missing number of arguments to lambda it will raises Argument error where as
   proc will have a block like behaviour I we pass missing number of arguments to proc it will ignores them.
4.return statement inside lambda will return from lambda block rest of the code inside method will be executed but return statement inside
  proc will come out of the proc block and also it will come out of method in which it is defined.


PROCS::

  ex::
   proc without aruments:

    @proc_sample = Proc.new {puts "sample lambda";puts "another statement"}
    @proc_sample.call

 proc with arguments::
    @proc_sample = Proc.new {|i| puts i*100}
      @proc_sample.call(10)
    @proc_sample = Proc.new {|i,j| puts i*j}
      @proc_sample.call(10,20)

 1. procs are instances of Proc class
 2. procs will behave like a block i.e if you pass missing number arguments it will ignores


return statement inside proc and lambda::

def lambda_test
  lam = lambda { return }
  lam.call
  puts "Hello world"
end

lambda_test  


def proc_test
  proc = Proc.new { return }
  proc.call
  puts "Hello world"
end

proc_test  

def proc_test
  proc = Proc.new { return }
  proc.call
  puts "Hello world"
end

proc_test
1. lambda is method defined inside module class
